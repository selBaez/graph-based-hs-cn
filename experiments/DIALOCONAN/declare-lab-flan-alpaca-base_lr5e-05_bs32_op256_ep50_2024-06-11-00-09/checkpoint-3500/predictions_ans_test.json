        "Immigrants are part of our society and are valued for who they are. We should not discriminate against them.",
        "Jews are part of our society and we are proud of their contribution. They have always had a place in our society, I don't see anything \"controlling\" about them.",
        "Muslims are just as human as anyone else. Like Europeans. How can you say otherwise?",
        "Excuse me, but you can't tell me this when you don't have any data. The \"social problem\" you're referring to is mainly about economic inequality, not sexuality.",
        "There are many Muslims in Europe and many are very happy with their lives in our society. How can it be a win-win situation for them? Not to mention that ethnic cleansing is a crime under international law...",
        "I beg you to talk to a real lesbian. If you don't like men, you just don't. Many women who have been dating men then realize that they're gay, and being true to yourself is the best thing.",
        "Since you see gay people as being not normal, you might have to rethink your views on sexuality. Even if they have a different sexual orientation, gay people deserve respect.",
        "Children that are not exposed to the differences in our society tend to bully and play pranks more than children that learned about LGBT issues.",
        "If you are planning to spend a lot of time researching conspiracy theories you should read the critiques so you get a balanced view.",
        "The vast majority of of Muslims in this country are not violent. They're not a threat to our society in any way, they are simply normal citizens.",
        "So youre saying the solution to this is to put all migrants in camps and deport them? It's not feasible and more importantly it's a gross violation of human rights.",
        "That's not true at all. Look up what a diverse society is like and you'll see that Jews are always present as contributing members of society. This isn't the same as \"controlling\" everything.",
        "In 2016, there were 10.7 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S., or less than 3.5 percent of the nation's population. This represents a significant decrease both from the 12.2 million undocumented immigrants of 2007, and the 11.3 million of 2014. This is also the lowest total since 2004.",
        "What about the fact that black men are 4 times more likely to be killed by police than white men? There's a problem with prejudice and bias against black people, and we should stop this way of thinking.",
        "Societies grow strong with inclusion, and inclusion is about welcoming the people with other beliefs, like Muslims, in the first place.",
        "Jewish people have the right to have their beliefs respected as part of our society.",
        "Islam is not about oppression and intolerance.",
        "That sounds like a racist statement. Rape doesn't happen only from black men, there is no evidence to support that.",
        "How would you feel if you were isolated and confined, just because some random dude said that you're \"an abomination to god\" without a solid reason?",
        "Many studies have shown that immigrants tend to pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits. So the benefits they receive are not for free, but well paid back.",
        "The president was George W. Bush, the vice president was Dick Cheney, the national security advisor was Condoleeza Rice, and the secretary of defense was Donald Rumsfeld... all of them were in favor of the war and were the highest authorities that could decide for the United States. None of them are Jewish.",
        "Yes, the reason was ignorance and fear of the otherness that some people saw in LGBT people. I'm glad we're at a place as a society now where the majority of people accept that everyone is different, and who somebody chooses to love is none of anyone's business, and is definitely not their problem!",
        "Loafers? We have always had a very strong working class, and of course immigrants contribute to the creation of this.",
        "We are all equal in the eyes of the law, and we are all born equal in dignity and rights. Diversity of thought and belief is a strength, discrimination is not.",
        "Women are just as capable of feeling emotions as men, and men can likewise be just as empathic.",
        "To claim that the Holocaust is a myth is just wrong. Jews were victims of a genocidal regime.",
        "We are a country founded upon maintaining the rights of people, not undermining and eroding those rights.",
        "Muslims do not appear to have been excluded from the European Convention on Human Rights, and this is because they have human dignity to be protected.",
        "So this is really going to be about race? No matter what ethnicity or religion the children of the future are, we are all human!",
        "Women are often selfless, but even if they weren't, they deserve respect and dignity in their choice."
