        "This is not true. In my opinion, Muslims are just as human as anyone else and a benefit to our country.",
        "Homosexuality is not a sickness, there's no evidence of that. This is a myth created to discriminated based on sexual orientation and is used nowadays as a weapon of hate directed at the LGBT+ community.",
        "In my opinion, the only sickness you have is the allergy to the word'mosque'",
        "Many migrants work hard and have a good reputation. They are often very helpful and good people. They are an asset, not something to get rid of.",
        "This is a myth which was created by anti-gay activists to demonise LGBTI people. To equate LGBTI people with paedophiles is just dangerous propaganda.",
        "Should any human being be deleted, just because you don't want them to be here?",
        "You can't, but it explains why even if white and black people commit the same crimes, only black people get caught. This happens especially for drug offenses: white people also carry drugs, probably even more than black people, but only black people get searched for them.",
        "The law of this country says that women have equal opportunities, but we have to ask ourselves: how do we really treat them?",
        "What? Who said that? Don't tell me \"Someone said it in a book\". Such a serious accusation should be presented in an objective way: you must bring strong evidence.",
        "All members of society, regardless of race, are judged based on their behaviour and their contribution to society.",
        "Women are human and they have choices. You have the right to have your own views, but such ideas of submissiveness have been holding back half the population of the world. What a waste of talents, and potential.",
        "You need to educate yourself about African countries if you think they are'shitholes', and if by that you mean they're not as economically developed, that's probably because all of their natural resources were pillaged and taken into ownership by European colonisers...",
        "Immigrants are part of our society and are valued for who they are. We should not discriminate against them.",
        "Jews are part of our society and we are proud of their contribution. They have always had a place in our society, I don't see anything \"controlling\" about them.",
        "Muslims are just as human as anyone else. Like Europeans. How can you say otherwise?",
        "Excuse me, but you can't tell me this when you don't have any data. The \"social problem\" you're referring to is mainly about economic inequality, not sexuality.",
        "There are many Muslims in Europe and many are very happy with their lives in our society. How can it be a win-win situation for them? Not to mention that ethnic cleansing is a crime under international law...",
        "I beg you to talk to a real lesbian. If you don't like men, you just don't. Many women who have been dating men then realize that they're gay, and being true to yourself is the best thing.",
        "Since you see gay people as being not normal, you might have to rethink your views on sexuality. Even if they have a different sexual orientation, gay people deserve respect.",
        "Children that are not exposed to the differences in our society tend to bully and play pranks more than children that learned about LGBT issues.",
        "If you are planning to spend a lot of time researching conspiracy theories you should read the critiques so you get a balanced view.",
        "The vast majority of of Muslims in this country are not violent. They're not a threat to our society in any way, they are simply normal citizens.",
        "So youre saying the solution to this is to put all migrants in camps and deport them? It's not feasible and more importantly it's a gross violation of human rights.",
        "That's not true at all. Look up what a diverse society is like and you'll see that Jews are always present as contributing members of society. This isn't the same as \"controlling\" everything.",
        "In 2016, there were 10.7 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S., or less than 3.5 percent of the nation's population. This represents a significant decrease both from the 12.2 million undocumented immigrants of 2007, and the 11.3 million of 2014. This is also the lowest total since 2004.",
        "What about the fact that black men are 4 times more likely to be killed by police than white men? There's a problem with prejudice and bias against black people, and we should stop this way of thinking.",
        "Societies grow strong with inclusion, and inclusion is about welcoming the people with other beliefs, like Muslims, in the first place.",
        "Jewish people have the right to have their beliefs respected as part of our society.",
        "Islam is not about oppression and intolerance.",
        "That sounds like a racist statement. Rape doesn't happen only from black men, there is no evidence to support that.",
        "How would you feel if you were isolated and confined, just because some random dude said that you're \"an abomination to god\" without a solid reason?",
        "Many studies have shown that immigrants tend to pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits. So the benefits they receive are not for free, but well paid back.",
        "The president was George W. Bush, the vice president was Dick Cheney, the national security advisor was Condoleeza Rice, and the secretary of defense was Donald Rumsfeld... all of them were in favor of the war and were the highest authorities that could decide for the United States. None of them are Jewish.",
        "Yes, the reason was ignorance and fear of the otherness that some people saw in LGBT people. I'm glad we're at a place as a society now where the majority of people accept that everyone is different, and who somebody chooses to love is none of anyone's business, and is definitely not their problem!",
        "Loafers? We have always had a very strong working class, and of course immigrants contribute to the creation of this.",
        "We are all equal in the eyes of the law, and we are all born equal in dignity and rights. Diversity of thought and belief is a strength, discrimination is not.",
        "Women are just as capable of feeling emotions as men, and men can likewise be just as empathic.",
        "To claim that the Holocaust is a myth is just wrong. Jews were victims of a genocidal regime.",
        "We are a country founded upon maintaining the rights of people, not undermining and eroding those rights.",
        "Muslims do not appear to have been excluded from the European Convention on Human Rights, and this is because they have human dignity to be protected.",
        "So this is really going to be about race? No matter what ethnicity or religion the children of the future are, we are all human!",
