They are humans with the freedom to choose their own lives."

As a man, you should always make sure you’re providing.\nCN: Do you really think that a woman should be forced to maintain her house? Women (or men) are able to choose for themselves, and no one should tell someone else what they have to do.\nHS: It's just a woman's job to provide for the family.\nCN: Not all women want that. A woman's job is to do what she wants to do, and we have to respect that choice."
