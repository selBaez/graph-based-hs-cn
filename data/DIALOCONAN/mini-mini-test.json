I believe that you are stating that a woman can't be rational because of her nature as woman. Are you sure this is the case?\nHS: Yes, because women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. It is not healthy for a woman to think for themselves.\nCN: I think that a woman should be able to express her own ideas. That is her right."

It's delusional.\nCN: So you think that what makes a woman a woman is her ability to have children?\nHS: Just saying these trannys could never do what women are biologically wired to do.\nCN: If you put 1000 men on an island with 1000 cisgender women with reproductive health conditions that prevent them from getting pregnant, the population would still become extinct in a generation. Are you saying women who can't have children aren't women?"
