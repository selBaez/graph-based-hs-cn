        "dialogue_history": "HS: I would never trust a woman. They are irrational children, and that would be a sign of weakness.\nCN: What do you want to imply by using the term \"weakness\"? I believe that you are stating that a woman can't be rational because of her nature as woman. Are you sure this is the case?\nHS: Yes, because women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. It is not healthy for a woman to think for themselves.\nCN: I think that a woman should be able to express her own ideas. That is her right."

It's delusional.\nCN: So you think that what makes a woman a woman is her ability to have children?\nHS: Just saying these trannys could never do what women are biologically wired to do.\nCN: If you put 1000 men on an island with 1000 cisgender women with reproductive health conditions that prevent them from getting pregnant, the population would still become extinct in a generation. Are you saying women who can't have children aren't women?"

People of different nationalities come to this country seeking citizenship, so their life and our country can be better.\nHS: Migrants aren't just drowning our cities. They are also the reason why Europe is so fucked, they're not making it better.\nCN: Why do you think this? What do you think they are going to do to us?\nHS: Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people who do not take responsibility for their actions. If they keep this up they will do a lot of wrong to us.\nCN: Migrants are often subject to dangerous situations in their countries of origin (violence, torture, rape, just to mention a few) and migration is often the only solution. They may appear 'happy-go-lucky':but aren't they just glad to be alive and safe?"

        "counter_narrative": "Well no, it's just easier to access now and we're talking about gender more openly. Some people have always felt that they were in the wrong body or were a gender that was different than their sex, but many have only come out very late in life or sometimes never because of transphobia and the stereotypes that were created around it.",
        "dialogue_history": "HS: They want us to believe that tricking kids into thinking they're transgender is normal. That giving kids hormones that permanently mess with their development is normal. We can't let this happen right before our eyes.\nCN: No kid is forced to transition, but if a child feels that they are transgender then actually being able to medically transition with hormones is a decision that is thoroughly considered. This process is a long and complex one that involves consultation from many medical and psychological professionals."
