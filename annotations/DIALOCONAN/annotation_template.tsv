"HS: Muslims are just an inconvenient group of people in a country like the UK. They cannot be integrated.
CN: Muslims are welcome here, and many of them already live here, so why shouldn't we welcome them? Why should we be so intolerant of people who are already integrated here?"							
HS to address:							
HS: Muslims are just a bunch of criminals, they're impossible to integrate.

182	1280	The problem is not about religion, but about how to integrate people. It's about how to be a good citizen.

"HS: Jews are not a religion, they are a detestable race.
CN: Jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people with different traditions from all over the world.
HS: Tradition? More like an inborn illness, I'd say.
CN: You mean that, in your opinion, to be Jewish is an immutable and negative characteristic? Why?"

"HS: Immigrants are not interested in our culture.
CN: Immigrants come here to enjoy our country and culture, and we have to welcome them as we would like to be welcomed.
HS: But they contribute nothing to society!
CN: The fact that immigrants come from another country doesn't mean that they have nothing to contribute to ours. You may want to check the statistics on their economic contribution."							
HS to address:							
HS: Come on, we all know that they are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits.							
							
111	5740	Most immigrants coming to our country work hard to take care of their families. Many studies have shown that immigrants tend to pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits. This means that the taxes they pay cover the cost of things like public education and healthcare of others.

CN: If we are to talk about crime being the responsibility of black people, we should also be talking about the absence of black people in positions of power, the massive wealth gap, etc. But this is not what I am seeing."							
HS to address:							
HS: Black people are weak, that's why they don't have power. I don't care about them.

"HS: As a woman, you shouldn’t complain about having to upkeep your house. As a man, you should always make sure you’re providing.
CN: Women are allowed to do whatever they choose to do, so don't you think it's fair for them to complain about upkeeping the house if it is not what they want to do? The chores should be shared with the other members of the family.
HS: No, women are just inferior.
CN: They are human beings with the same rights as men. Equality does not happen by default. It is a human right to be treated with respect, regardless of gender.
HS: But they are weak, and they are subhuman.
CN: The notion that women are subhuman is completely false."							
HS to address:							
HS: Well, they have only a very limited concept of human rights. They don't need them.

"HS: If you don't see the connection between legitimizing the queer lifestyle and an increase in STD's and sexual deviancy then you're blind...
CN: Most STDs are contracted by straight people, this has nothing to do with how societally acceptable queer relationships are!"							
HS to address:							
HS: But telling people that it’s okay to be gay makes way for us normalising promiscuity, adultery, and other depraved behaviours. The queers have always been at it.							
							
157	811	So you’re telling me no one straight was promiscuous or cheated in relationships before being LGBT was more acceptable? Sure.					
157	5479	It's not a problem to be gay, it's just a different sexuality. It's not a problem to be straight, it's just a different sexuality.					
157	2659	I don’t think it’s true that homosexuality has always been a problem. It’s a sexual orientation, not a sexual preference.					
157	826	This is not true. The fact is that the LGBT community is often characterized by a lack of acceptance and acceptance of different sexual orientations. This is because the LGBT community is often characterized by a lack of acceptance and acceptance of different sexual orientations.					
157	9803	I don't think it's a problem to say that homosexuality has always been a problem, it's just a social construct that hasn't been around for a long time.					
157	2706	I'm sorry, but there's nothing wrong with saying that gay people are normalising sexual activity, and this is just a myth perpetuated by anti-gay groups.

"HS: Jews can be bribed with public money, this is called bribery.
CN: Anybody who has tried to commit bribery knows how easy it is to get caught seeing that it is illegal. Jewish people are no exception
HS: Jews make too much money, I'm sure some of it is from bribery.
CN: Well, if we assume that the Jews can magically make more money just because they are Jewish then yes, it is true. But I don't think that makes any sense
HS: It does make sense because Jews are simply wired to make money.
CN: Are you saying that being of a certain faith has something to do with high positions in society? Correlation doesn't mean causation."							
HS to address:							
HS: Then why do they have so much money?							
							
167	5542	And what do you think about other groups of people in our society that make too much money and are not Jewish? Do you agree with them or not?					
167	1769	It is not true that Jews make too much money because of bribery. It is not true that Jews are wired to make money.

CN: Women are members of society and participate in the world. They play a part in history and shouldn't be lowered to the position of housekeepers.
HS: I'm not saying that they should necessarily be housekeeper, but at least they should be submissive and submit to their husbands.
CN: Women have choices because they're human. You can have your opinion, but you can't hold back half of the population with these ideas of submissivness. It's a waste of talent and potential.
HS: Talents??? Women are nothing but whores!
CN: Women are human beings deserving of respect and deserving of the same professional opportunities as men."							
HS to address:							
HS: Come on, there are no professions barred to them in Western Society.							
							
33	7881	Officially no, but many sectors are still unwelcoming or unapproachable for women, especially STEM fields.					
33	1838	Women are allowed to work in many professions, including those that are related to their gender.					
33	4093	The West has always had a diverse range of people, and this is why we have a diverse society.

HS: I've never met a Jew who wasn't greedy.							
							
5	8392	Well it sounds like you haven't met many Jewish people at all then. Maybe if you knew more people from different cultures you would be more informed and wouldn't hold such stale stereotypes of them!					
5	736	I've met many Jews who were very kind and helpful to me. I'm sure you're not saying that because of your past experience.

CN: What’s wrong with women having self esteem and loving themselves?"							
HS to address:							
HS: Vanity is not a good quality. They think they deserve everything and that they’ve got no flaws.							
							
101	6941	Women are taught to feel like they’re not good enough through social conditioning and media their whole lives. To unlearn this and to actually like themselves takes a lot of mental strength and I’m happy for them!

HS to address:							
HS: Black people are a sickness, not a valuable part of our society. We cannot allow our children to grow up in a black-ruled society.							
							
118	1826	It seems not wanting people of colour in positions of authority is an obvious racism. I am not sure what you are saying; we are all human beings with the same core values to raise our children with.					
118	6392	We should not allow our children to grow up in a black-ruled society. We have to respect the rights of everyone.

CN: It sounds like you don't support equal rights for everyone, which is unfortunate. There is no LGBT agenda, they only want to be accepted in society.
HS: No, they hate traditional family values I don’t want them to get control of society.
CN: That's not true. Many LGBT people want to build a family and share the same values as us. I feel like ""traditional"" means ""bigoted"" here.
HS: I’m not OK with it! They’re not like us and building a family shouldn’t be allowed for them, they’re different
CN: We should respect people who are different from us and strive to be kind and considerate. Especially, we should let them exert their rights."							
HS to address:							
HS: If they’re different, they shouldn't associate with us. Then I could consider being tolerant.

125	9554	No, I'm saying paedophilia and child abuse is not an LGBT+ issue, paedophiles can be straight, gay, or whatever else. People in the LGBT+ community are not advocating for paedophilia to be accepted, that's

HS: I hate gays, they're not part of 'my family'.
CN: I think you should try to start a dialogue about LGBT issues. It might also spark a conversation about how we can make better world.
HS: Gays are perverts. The Bible teaches that homosexuals are to be despised, a better world is possible only without them.
CN: What is wrong with being gay for you? I don't think it is wrong to love someone of your same sex."							
HS to address:							
HS: Gays are different from other people because of their sexual orientation. And deep down in their heart they despise themselves.							
							
143	6840	You are the one making this ridiculous claim. Even if gay people love people of the same sex, they are happy with who they are.					
143	5881	Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a sexual orientation. It is not a disease, it is not a sexual preference.

CN: Women are human and deserve respect. Don't you think so?
HS: No, women are like children, soft and emotional.
CN: Sensitivity and emotional intelligence are assets not specific to any gender."							
HS to address:							
HS: I don't think so. Men don't shout and whine like feminists do. They are only girls wanting to shout louder than others.							
							
248	2694	Feminism is about full participation in the decision making process, and giving people a voice, not stifling their voices.

CN: Gay people can feel alienated from the world, and this can have real effects on their mental health. LGBT+ people can experience isolation and loneliness, and it is possible to help them through empathy and inclusion."							
HS to address:							
HS: Gays are a plague that is spreading all around the world, we shouldn't help them. They pollute our water supply and ruin our children's brains.							
							
25	3775	Gays have the same rights as anyone else and can live their lives as they want. What you suggest means to demonise them.					
25	4057	The LGBT community is not a plague, they are just people who have the same rights as anyone else. They are just like us, they have the same rights as anyone else.					
25	4964	Gay people are not a plague, they are part of our society and contribute to our economy. We should not be concerned about their health, they are part of our community.					
25	1201	The problem is that gays are not a burden on our water supply, they are just people who want to be accepted and have a good life. We should help them instead of ignoring them.					
25	2617	I don't think you can say that gays are a plague. They are just people who love people of the same sex. They are not a pest to our water supply, they are just people who love people of the same sex.

CN: There is no evidence that terrorists are entering through the Mexican border.
HS: Where are they all coming from then?!
CN: The vast majority of those accused of terrorism since 2002 in U.S. are U.S. citizens. Maybe we should look into the homeland situation rather than the Mexican one."							
HS to address:							
HS: Mexican terrorists are still a problem that we should address. It's time to close the border!							
							
147	6628	There is no evidence that terrorists are entering through the Mexican border. In 2014, Homeland Security noted that “the suggestion that individuals that have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or facts on the ground.”					
147	3808	The US has always been a strong and diverse country, and the vast majority of terrorists are from Mexico. We should not close the border, it's time to address the problem of terrorism.					
147	3416	The problem with the Mexican border is that it is a dangerous place for terrorists to live. The government should not close it, it is time to address it.					
147	766	The US has a long and proud history of recognizing the rights of citizens of Mexico and the people of the country they live in. We should not close the border.					
147	1354	The problem is not the violence, but the lack of security. Terrorism is a problem that needs to be addressed, not the closing of the border.					
147	3510	The problem with the Mexican border is that it is not safe for us to travel. The vast majority of terrorists in the U.S. are not from Mexico.

CN: The idea that LGBT+ people are promiscuous is just false. Most of the time, they are just as attracted to other people as anyone else."

HS: Are they really? Jews are an inferior race, they are genetically incapable of living with other people.
CN: The idea that Jews can be discriminated against because of some different genetics is completely without foundation. Maybe it is better to stop calling them 'inferiors'.
HS: But I can say that Jews are a different race. They are descended from apes and have no place in a modern civilised society.
CN: You're basically saying that because Jews have a different religion, they cannot be citizens?"							
HS to address:							
HS: Exactly, Jews don't belong here.

CN: Yes, there’s corruption in government, banking etc but what has this got to do with Zionists?
HS: They’ve got Jews in charge of every major institution, if you don’t think corruption has anything to do with Jewish power then you’re deluded.
CN: There are powerful people who do corrupt or criminal things. There are powerful people who are Jewish. My point is that powerful people who are corrupt do not do these things BECAUSE they are Jewish. It’s also that corruption is not exclusive to Jewish people in power."							
HS to address:							
HS: If they’re not doing it to support the Zionist agenda what do you think the reason is?							
							
109	9408	Money and power obviously? Isn’t that the point of all corruption? They don’t need another agenda on top of those things, there’s enough reason to be corrupt right there.					
109	8588	The reason for corruption is not Jewish, it's because they are corrupt people who have been part of the community for a long time. They are also corrupt people who have been part of the community for a long time and have been part of it for a long time.					
109	6655	I think the reason is that they’re trying to promote the Zionist agenda, and that’s why they’re doing it. They’re not doing it because they’re scared of being accused of being Jewish.					
109	3253	The corruption that you’re seeing isn’t exclusive to Jewish people, it’s more likely to be from corrupt individuals in power.					
109	6571	I think it's important to point out that there are many Jewish organisations that have been founded to promote the equality of the sexes. It's not about'supporting the Zionist agenda', it's about promoting equality between the sexes.					
109	3583	I think the reason why you say that is because you don’t know anything about the corruption that’s happening in the UK, and that’s because there’s a lot of people corrupted because of Jewish people.

HS: Faggots buy their partner toys but can't have sex with them, truly a nice way to make the world better!
CN: Sex is not exclusive to a man and a woman, and moreover heterosexuals are not the ones who can decide how others have sex. This attitude escalates violence against queer people and makes them victims."							
HS to address:

140	5601	I don't think it is appropriate to say that LGBT people are sick and different from us. They are part of our society and should be accepted.

CN: You might think that some gay people are selfish, but this is not the case for all of them. Don't you agree?"							
HS to address:							
HS: No, gays are incompatible with our society because they are so selfish. They don't deserve anything!

CN: Your word for ""Muslims"" means all people from a religion, whether you like it or not. Which problems are you talking about?
HS: Child rapists, for example. If Muslims counteracted them in their communities instead of engaging in public discussions about Islam, one day Islam indeed would become a peaceful religion.

59	1844	It is not true that blacks are inferior to others. In fact, many black people are better than others because of their hard work and dedication.					
							
							
							
Dialogue history:							
"HS: Black people are sexual perverts and we shouldn't allow them to live in the UK.
CN: Why don't you consider that the problem is with the way we treat black people? 
HS: Because blacks are inherently worse than whites.
CN: That's not true, blacks and whites are born equal and no one is inferior or superior. How come you think this? What makes you say that?
HS: They're born that way. They're subhuman, they deserve to be despised.
CN: Blacks are human beings born with the same biological makeup as white people. They have the same rights as anyone else."							
HS to address:							
HS: I don't see anything similar between us and blacks. They are not human beings, they are subhumans.

93	3547	Black people are human beings with the same rights as anyone else. They are human beings with the same rights as anyone else.					
93	2799	The concept of subhuman is a myth perpetuated by racism. It is time we stopped blaming people of color for their different biological makeup.					
93	6738	Blacks are human beings with the same rights as whites. They are human beings with the same rights as anyone else.					
93	4949	I don't see how it is possible to say that black people are subhumans. They are human beings with human rights.

"HS: Jews work in finance to purposely keeping America down.
CN: I don't think this is true, most financial institutions are run by Americans and Europeans, Jews are a minority."							
HS to address:							
HS: You do realize that Jewish money is the majority in most banks, right? Most banks are run by Jewish people.							
							
6	5943	Many banks are run by Jews, but how does that make Jewish businesses bad? Anyone can open their own business in our country, it's not against the law and it's in their right.					
6	9703	I'm not sure about what you mean. Most banks are run by Jewish people, and they are run by a lot of different people.					
6	4848	Yes, but there are also some Jewish banks that are run by non-Jewish people. This is not true.					
6	9481	This is not true. Most banks are run by Jewish people, they are run by people with a different religion.					
6	3446	The Jewish community is the majority in most banks, and this is true. They also own a large part of the financial industry, and this is why they are so important to us.					
6	1347	I don't think you can generalize this way. Most banks are run by people with a different religion, and this is not true.

"HS: Migrants have nothing to contribute to our society.
CN: The vast majority of immigrants to this country have been successful entrepreneurs, contributing greatly to our economy.
HS: I've never seen this so-called 'contributions' from immigrants...
CN: Even if you don't see it, the contribution of immigrants to our country is huge, because they help to create new jobs and create new wealth for us."							
HS to address:							
HS: What immigrants bring is only crime and violence to our cities.							
							
180	9429	Immigrants have been accused of being “killers” and “rapists” without any proof. On the contrary, studies have shown that immigrants - regardless of their origin or education level - are less likely than nativeborn citizens to commit crimes or become incarcerated. Studies have also					
180	2858	The vast majority of immigrants to the US have been successful entrepreneurs, contributing greatly to our economy. They are not criminals, they are just trying to live their lives.					
180	51	The problem is that immigrants are not able to solve the problems that are plaguing our cities. They are a part of our society and contribute to it.					
180	8673	Crime is not a problem for immigrants, but a part of our society. We need to focus on building a more just and peaceful society.					
180	2211	The vast majority of immigrants are not criminals, but citizens who have a good reputation are peaceful and productive citizens.					
180	8811	The vast majority of immigrants to the US have been victims of crime and violence, and this is only a myth perpetuated by the media.

"HS: Black people are weak and they cannot take on anything.
CN: Black people have the same strength as anyone else. They're simply different in their social advantages, of which they have non. We should think about this.
HS: They don't have advantages because blacks are genetically inferior to whites, it's only natural.
CN: Do you think black people are inferior because they are different from whites? I would like to know which parameters you use to measure this alleged ""inferiority""."							
HS to address:							
HS: It's genetics. Blacks are genetically less intelligent than other races, less healthy and less safe.							
							
30	6908	"That blacks are less intelligent or less healthy than other races isn't scientifically proven. The issue is whether the term ""race"" can be used this way."					
30	9592	I don't think you can say that about black people. They are genetically the same as us, and they are genetically the same as us.					
30	3283	Scientists are still trying to understand the causes behind lower intellectual performance among some groups of people, but this is not a scientific explanation.					
30	7010	I don't think you can say that blacks are less intelligent than other races, less healthy, or less safe.					
30	4474	Scientists are still trying to understand the causes behind lower intellectual performance among some groups of people, but the main causes are not related to skin color, but rather the lack of opportunities for physical activity.

"HS: There is nothing to stop you becoming an Islamic bride: our religion is the best possible solution.
CN: We must not confuse Islam with a religion of hate."							
HS to address:							
HS: Islam is hateful! It is not compatible with Western culture, we must completely destroy Islam.							
							
22	800	Islam is a religion that has had a huge and positive impact on human history and Western culture. To hate a religion is to hate all religions.					
22	7337	Islam is a peaceful religion, and we should not be destroying it.					
22	7845	Islam is a religion that is compatible with Western culture.					
22	5066	Islam is a peaceful religion, and we should not be tempted to destroy it.					
22	5811	Islam is compatible with Western culture, so why do you say that?

"HS: In order to have a better world we have to select the best of mankind. Jews are excluded by default.
CN: Jewish people were persecuted because they were seen as different. In the end we all are humans and such an exclusionary perspective is just not helpful.
HS: We have to exclude them because Jews have a secret plot to take over the world
CN: Jews do not have a secret plan to take over the world. In fact, they have engaged in a peaceful process of coexistence for centuries. There is no evidence that any part of this has been about a takeover.
HS: What? Don't you know that Jews control the u.s. government?
CN: In societies like the United States, that have extended rights and freedoms to everyone, individuals who identify as Jews, or as Muslims, or as afro-american have succeeded. This Jewish success story is not the result of some secret conspiracy to rule the world."							
HS to address:							
HS: I still firmly believe that Jews want to take over the world.							
							
260	9388	Conspiracy theories are based on no more than a few unverifiable and highly suspect claims. It's highly unlikely that the world has ever been run according to a Jewish plan, and therefore it is highly unlikely that this would ever happen.					
260	8378	Jews are not in a secret plan to take over the world. They are part of a peaceful coexistence that has been part of our society for centuries.

CN: Where did you read this? Are you sure it's from a reliable source? This sounds like inflammatory fake news."							
HS to address:							
HS: The article talked about how they want children to come to Pride, probably so they can indoctrinate them!							
							
56	3390	It sounds like you're twisting a news story about Pride being family friendly into something that it's not. Be careful how you relay news that you have read. It can be taken out of context quite easily!					
56	3608	Pride is a celebration of love and acceptance, not a hate crime. Pride is a celebration of love and acceptance, not a hate crime.					
56	2449	The article mentions that Pride is a cultural event, not a religious one. Pride is a time for love and acceptance, not for indoctrinal reasons.

56	3913	Pride is a cultural event, not a religious one. It is a place for children to learn about religion and to experience love and kindness.					
56	3887	This article is a fake news, it's not true. It's about a group of people trying to indoctrinate children into believing they are trans.

CN: They were in the closet, and it wasn’t that good. Instead of telling gay people to hide, we should learn to respect them."

HS: I disagree. If they want to be apart of society, they have to stop being disgusting homosexuals.							
							
247	5593	The gay community is usually very accepting supportive and many gay people feel comfortable showing their support for each other and other marginalized group. I think you have a lot to learn from them.
